"""Gather information about a domain name and produce a report about it.

Rough early specs:

    Output of the report should be in JSON.

    Input should be a domain name (maybe some additional sub-domains?)

    There should be a binary that uses the library and formats the report to
    screen

    There should be some configuration format that lets you mark whether
    reported hosts are known to be something and whether it's problematic to
    the user or not. maybe only for the binary? It should be possible for users
    to specify an alternative configuration file.
